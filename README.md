### Blender Multi-Curve Length Calculator

This Python script for Blender allows you to calculate the total length of multiple selected curves (**Bezier**, **NURBS**, or **POLY**) in the scene. The script sums the lengths of all selected curves and displays the result both in **Blender units** and **kilometers (km)**.

#### Features:
- Supports multiple curve types: **Bezier**, **NURBS**, and **POLY**.
- Calculates the total length of all selected curves in the scene.
- Displays the total length in **Blender units** as well as in **kilometers**.
- Shows results in both the Blender console and in a popup window for convenience.
- Provides high precision with results displayed to 6 decimal places.

#### Usage:
1. **Select** the curves you want to calculate the length for.
2. Open the **Text Editor** in Blender, paste the script, and **Run Script**.
3. The script will calculate the total length of all selected curves and display the result in the console and a popup window.

#### Example:
- Total length of selected curves: `33262.078612 units`
- Total length converted to kilometers: `33.262079 km`

#### Precision:
By default, the script provides precision up to 6 decimal places. You can easily adjust this by modifying the format of the printed output if needed.

#### How to Use:
- Download the script and open it in Blender's **Text Editor**.
- Select multiple curves in the 3D viewport.
- Run the script to get the total length of the selected curves in kilometers and Blender units.

This tool is particularly useful for measuring the total length of roads, paths, or any other curved structures in your scene that need to be calculated with precision.
